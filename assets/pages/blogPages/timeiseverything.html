                    <p><h3 style="display: inline-block">In physics</h3>, we learn that for every action, there is an
                    equal and opposite reaction. An induced current will produce a magnetic field in the opposite
                    direction. These laws of conservation are found everywhere in the physical world and one of the
                    coolest things about this is that it doesn't take a physicist to understand this. This
                    physical observation is found in "non-physical" scenes as well. For instance, taking that last slice of pizza (action)
                    just means that someone else won't get it (reaction). Forgetting to buy a present for your friend's
                    birthday means that you'll have one less friend
                    <i>(Just kidding, hopefully that doesn't happen).</i></p>

                    <p><h3 style="display: inline-block">But here's the catch.</h3>
                    In the examples above, <strong>time</strong> was not an important/emphasized variable. Sure you
                    could take the list slice of pizza, but you can just buy another one. And sure you forgot it was
                    your friend's birthday, but you can always just get them a late gift. This is
                    <span style="color: red">important</span> because time is the one variable in all of the universe that is not conserved.
                    To get an idea of what this means, image yourself just sitting down on the floor doing
                    <strong>absolutely nothing.</strong> As you are sitting there, time is ticking down, but nothing is
                    happening. You aren't getting any healthier and you're not learning anything. <strong>You
                    are wasting time.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p><h3 style="display: inline-block">I find this to be a significant observation</h3> because it means that we have to
                    make meaningful decisions everyday in order to become successful. Optimizing our day-to-day schedule is part of this decision process.
                    We have to spend less time doing things that don't benefit you, like playing LoL, and more time doing things that
                    matter such as side projects or working on becoming a better person.</p>

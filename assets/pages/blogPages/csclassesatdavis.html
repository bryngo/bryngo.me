                        classes I've taken at UC Davis and my thoughts on them. If you don't go/plan on going to UC Davis,
                        this may not make too much sense to you. Classes will be listed in the order in which I took them.

                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Required: Yes</h5></i>
                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Difficulty: 4/10</h5></i>

                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Taken: Year 1, Fall</h5></i>

                        <p>ECS 30, my very first programming course. Actually, I took one in High School, but it was more of an experimental course. In other words, there wasn't many concepts I learned from that high school course
                    that I took to college.</p>

                    <p>That being said, UC Davis <a href="https://ucdavis.app.box.com/s/1ovr48zs5jdm7t8nhki98rcry2xr6jmw">suggests</a> taking ECS 10 first if you are completely new to programming. I am here to suggest that
                    <strong>you will be fine</strong> starting with ECS 30 as your first course. Yes, taking ECS 30 as your first course may require a bit more work out of you, but it's way better than spending a quarter taking a class
                    that "warms" you up to the rigor computer science courses have to offer. After all, you will be up against time for the rest of your life, so there's no reason to waste it taking classes you don't need. </p>

                    <p>The actual work that this course required was not high in quantity at all. The department knows that this is the course many computer science students take first, so their plan is not to burn you out in your first course.
                    None of the programs (which was about 1 a week, some with multiple parts) were terrible long/difficult to understand. </p>

                    <p>In short, take this class ASAP. If you are new to programming, it will require a bit of work to learn all the material thoroughly, but it's completely do-able.</p>

                    <h2 style="display: inline-block">ECS 40 <h4 style="display: inline"> (Software & Object Oriented Programming) </h4> </h2>

                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Professor: Sean Davis</h5></i>
                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Required: Yes</h5></i>
                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Difficulty: 8/10</h5></i>
                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Pre-requisites: ECS30</h5></i>
                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Skills/Concepts: C/C++, UNIX Command Line, Shell Scripting, Classes, Pointers, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Stacks, Queues, Vectors, Maps/Multimaps. </h5></i>
                        <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Taken: Year 1, Winter</h5></i>

                    <p>If you are new to programming in general, this class <strong>will be a struggle</strong>. Sean does not have you writing those simple "calculator" programs
                       that you'll find in a lot of synonymous classes (sorry, but I find those programs simple as hell, with minimal value). He will assign programs that have been
                       refined over the years to pose as a manageable challenge to the student. With these programs being assigned once a week, you're in for a challenging course.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>But don't be afraid.</strong> In this class, you will learn a lot. In addition to learning how to program with C/C++, you'll learn how to use the command line. The command line is
                        another discussion in itself, but it is an extremely beneficial skill that every computer scientist should have, to say the least. Unfortunately this information may not be very useful as
                        Sean is retiring very soon. But if you do find this and see that Sean is teaching a course you have to take, do take. It'll be worth your while. Additionally, a lot of his lectures are
                        archived, so you can view them at 1.5x at home!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This class will also require some work. For me, I couldn't just go to lecture and Ace the exams without supplemental practice. Unfortunately, I didn't get this idea nailed in to me until
                        the final came around.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That being said, my tips for this class would be to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Go to lecture</li>
                            <li>Go to discussion</li>
                            <li>Do practice exams/problems from discussions/from his website</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Professor Koehl is an extremely caring professor. He wants all of his students to do well, so he provides many resources for you to do so. <strong>So, take advantage of this</strong>. There's
                        not many professors who have such a well established learning environment, so make use of it. Doing extra problems that can be found on his website will greatly help you when the exams come
                        around. It would be in your best interest to do them.
                    </p>

                        From left to right, those are the grade distributions for midterm 1, midterm 2, and the final exam. With the slight exception of midterm 2, there is a heavy skew to the left. Hopefully, it goes
                        without saying that this class is very manageable. What makes the average on the exams so high? Well, it's a combination of allowing open notes and test recycling.
                        I don't remember what happened to the averages on midterm 2 with the class, but the exams are generally pretty easy. Generally, the exams will require you to write machine code and recite facts
                        discussed in lecture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As far as class content, a majority of what you'll be learning revolves around assembly language. I admit it's not the most enjoyable language. It's one of those languages
                        that eats up a lot of your time with not much knowledge gain in return. It's a pretty simple language to grasp, just not too interesting.

                    <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Professor: Sean Davis</h5></i>

                    <i><h5 style="color: #969797"> Taken: Year 2, Fall</h5></i>
                    <p>
                        By the time you're reading this, Sean is probably retired. Regardless of that fact, I'll still share my thoughts about the class with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sean is pretty much the only prof/lecturer to regularly teach ECS60 here at Davis. There's a couple other professors, but they're usually found teching it in the summer.
                        This class is pretty much the most important class to take just because it opens up many doors to upper division courses and career opportunities. Do note that when I say it
                        open doors to career opportunities, it <strong style="color: red;">DOES NOT</strong> mean you can just walk out of the class with an A and expect to know everything to pass
                        a technical interview at Google. The required knowledge for such a task is another topic in itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this class, you'll learn about a bunch of data structures/trees including Splay Tree, BST, AVL Tree, B+ Tree, Hash Tables, Heaps, and a couple other I'm probably forgetting.
                        You'll also learn about algorithms including Dijkstra's, Ford-Fulkerson, Prim's, Kruskal's, Topological sort, DFS, BFS, Articulation Points, Huffman Encoding, Smart Unions, and, again,
                        probably a couple more I'm forgetting. The sorting algorithms you learn include insertion sort, quick sort, radix sort, shell sort, heap sort, merge sort, indirect sort, bucket sort,
                        and external sort. (Note to self: Organize this list into a prettier format)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the above algorithms are pretty easy to understand/perform. Most of Sean's tests will ask you to perform a select few algorithms and they're generally pretty straight
                        forward. The majority of the difficulty that comes from the class is with his challenge programs (2). These challenge programs will more than likely require you
                        to implement one of the listed algorithms/data structures to perform a task that Sean has created. I should note that the solutions to his challenge programs
                        are sometimes the most simple data structure, so don't over think them. Be sure to start early to allow time for debugging too!
